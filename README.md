## Modeling forecast scenarios in Germany (updated figures of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.01105))

Our aim is to quantify the effects of intervention policies on the spread of COVID-19. To that end, we built a Bayesian SIR model where we can incorporate our prior knowledge of the time points of governmental policy changes. While the first two change points were not sufficient to switch from growth of novel cases to a decline, the third change point (the strict contact ban initiated around March 23) brought this crucial reversal. - Now, since April 19, a number of stores have been opened and policies have been loosened on the one hand, which may lead to increased spreading (increased ![$\lambda^\ast$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Clambda%5E%5Cast%24)). On the other hand, masks are now widely used and contact tracing might start to show effect, which both may reduce the spread of the virus (decrease ![$\lambda^\ast$](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=%24%5Clambda%5E%5Cast%24)). We will only start to see the joint effects of the novel govenrmental policies and collective behavior with a delay of 2-3 weeks. Therefore we show alternative future scenarios here.

### Alternative forecast scenarios, projecting the relaxation of restrictions on April 19

  * __Scenario A__: If the relaxation of restrictions causes even a mild increase in effective growth rate, the daily new reported cases will increase again.
  * __Scenario B__: If the effective growth rate stays on the current (all-time low) value, new cases will further decrease. A low number of new daily cases might bring a full control of the spread within reach ([see our position paper by the four German research associations](https://www.mpg.de/14759871/corona-stellungnahme); [Endorsement](https://www.mpg.de/14760439/28-04-2020_Stellungnahme_Teil_01.pdf); [Position paper](https://www.mpg.de/14760439/28-04-2020_Stellungnahme_Teil_02.pdf)).

The two current scenarios are based on the model that incorporates weekly reporting modulation (less cases reported on weekends).
The distributions below correspond to the parameters the produce the time series.

## What-if scenarios

What if the growth would have continued with less change points?

We fitted the four scenarios to the number of new cases until respectively March 18th, March 25th, April 1st and April 7th.

This figure was used widely in German media, including TV, to illustrate the magnitude of the different change points.
